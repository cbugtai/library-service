 * - 'id' because we generate it automatically
 * - 'isBorrowed' because all new books start as not borrowed
 * - 'borrowerId' and 'dueDate' because they're only used when a book is borrowed
 *
 * @param bookData - The book information. Must include title, author, and genre.
 * @throws {Error} When required fields (title, author, genre) are missing
 * @returns {Book} The newly created book with generated ID and isBorrowed set to false
